We have created the following tables: 
  1. patients: stores information of the patients
  2. patient_history: stores diagnosis history of the patient
  3. upcoming_appointments: stores future scheduled visits of the paitent
  4. doctors: stores information of the doctors
  5. doctor_availabilty: stores doctorâ€™s availabilty schedule
  6. departments: stores information of the departments in  the hospital. 

## API Design 

We have created API set for all major flows of the application. 
The complete list and their documentation can be found here:
